      The art raffle has now concluded! We thank everyone who showed up or provided art.<br>
      We hope to see you next time!
    </p>
    <p class="info text fade text-base text-center mt-10">
        The art raffle is a community event crowdsourcing art and displaying them as a raffle. <br> If you're interested, think about creating a piece you'd like to raffle off! <br>
        We encourage any and all forms of art (as long as they are mobile), as there will be a gallery set up to host the raffle. <br>
        All raffle proceeds will go back directly do the artists who made the art piece. <br>
        The art raffle will be hosted at the <b> ECHO CHAMBER </b>, Friday April 12, at 8:30pm.<br>
        If you don't know where this is, please <a class="underline" href="mailto:ucfoodautonomy@protonmail.com">email us</a>  for details OR dm on instagram(@ucforestdefense). <br>

    <p class="text text-center text-lg italic underline decoration-double	" > We're so excited to see you all! </p>
