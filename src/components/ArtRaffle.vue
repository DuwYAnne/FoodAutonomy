        The art raffle is a community event crowdsourcing art and displaying them as a raffle. <br> If you're interested, think about creating a piece you'd like to raffle off! <br>
        We encourage any and all forms of art (as long as they are mobile), as there will be a gallery set up to host the raffle. <br>
        All raffle proceeds will go back directly do the artists who made the art piece. <br>
        More details coming soon! Email us any early questions/ideas at <a class="underline" href="mailto:ucfoodautonomy@protonmail.com">ucfoodautonomy@protonmail.com</a>
