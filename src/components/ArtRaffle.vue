        The art raffle is a community event crowdsourcing art from locals in order to support their art. <br> If you're interested, think about creating a piece you'd like to raffle off! <br>
        We encourage any and all forms of art (as long as they are mobile), as there will be a gallery set up to host the raffle. <br>
        More details coming soon! Email us any early questions/ideas at <a class="underline" href="mailto:ucfoodautonomy@protonmail.com">ucfoodautonomy@protonmail.com</a>
