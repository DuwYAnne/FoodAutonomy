      What is food autonomy?
    </h1>
    <p class="info text fade text-base mb-8">
      Food autonomy is a way of reconsidering what we value, caring for the earth and for other people above profit or efficiency. It wrests power away from corporations and the government, putting food sovereignty back into the hands of people. It tackles inequities by enabling local communities to develop their own solutions and food systems for their needs, rather than enabling profit-seeking capitalists to exploit people as they see fit. It centers ecological sustainability by enabling local ingenuity, experience, and wisdom to care for their land. It can be as simple as starting a garden, foraging and using the natural space around, or as complex as creating a food distribution center or a community gardening network; any and all efforts contribute to the goal of food autonomy.
