      Why are we having this event?
    </h1>
    <p class="info text fade text-base mb-8">
      Every day, forests are clearcut in enormous swathes to feed the machine of industrial monocultural agriculture, contributing to massive habitat loss and anthropogenic climate change. All the while, industry pollutes our air and water, people are denied the food they need to survive, and temperature records are shattered yearly. In the face of the colossal structural problems of capitalism and its abundance of economic and ecological justice issues, we hope to carve out a space for the exploration of alternative paths. We want to highlight the work done to take back food production, distribution, and consumption, and how these models can challenge our current inequitable and unsustainable system. This festival attempts to overturn our internal models of food, bringing autonomous, equitable, and sustainable food systems into the forefront of our thought. We will accomplish this through discussions and skillshares, giving us all a brief respite to connect and share without the expectations of capital.

      What is food autonomy?
    </h1>
    <p class="info text fade text-base mb-8">
      Food autonomy is a way of reconsidering what we value, caring for the earth and for other people above profit or efficiency. It wrests power away from corporations and the government, putting food sovereignty back into the hands of people. It tackles inequities by enabling local communities to develop their own solutions and food systems for their needs, rather than enabling profit-seeking capitalists to exploit people as they see fit. It centers ecological sustainability by enabling local ingenuity, experience, and wisdom to care for their land. It can be as simple as starting a garden, foraging and using the natural space around, or as complex as creating a food distribution center or a community gardening network; any and all efforts contribute to the goal of food autonomy.

      Food Autonomy and Resistance
    </h1>
    <p class="info text fade text-base mb-8">
      Food autonomy and ecological sustainability are not isolated struggles. Just and equitable food systems are an impossibility in a system which values capital over lives and colonizers over the colonized. We are intertwined with fights around the world: the climate crisis, the genocide of Palestinians, the swelling of police militarization and surveillance, the continued attacks on trans and queer peoples, etc. Food autonomy should mean not only democratic and sovereign food systems, but also the abolishing of unjust social and economic structures.
